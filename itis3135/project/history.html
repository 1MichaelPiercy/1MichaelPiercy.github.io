			Rental vans was founded by Andrew in 2016 on the bases of giving back to the community. Andrew wanted to give people that may not be able to afford vans for work, moving, 
			and family vacation a way to start or create the possibility for new memorys. Weather you used them to create a new life and start over or to go and work or vacation out of.
			He is doing that through this company and continues to do that through this company.
		</p>
		<p class="p">
			The company only had the basic passenger van. As it grew, so did the size of the fleet and the number of locations. The fleet of vans has grown from the basic passenger van to work vans.
			Currently it has gone up to a few campers and we plan to expand that portion of the fleet as well. As we grow, so does the amount of enjoyment we are able to give back to the community.

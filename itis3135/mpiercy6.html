         <li>Professional background: Currently I don't have a professional background in anything involving computers, just more of a educational experience with them. All though I do work at a local Chick-Fil-A and obtained shift lead. I have also done a little bit of side work with my dad, but mostly heavy lifting.</li>
         
         <li>
             Personal: I am 22 years old and have lived in Monroe, NC my whole life. I have 2 older siblings and I am the youngest of the three.
             Right now I am currently working at Chick-Fil-A and obtained shift lead there. I am also currently going to UNCC for a Bachelors in Computer Science.
             
            </li>

         <li>Academic: Right now I am in my 4th year of college and plan to graduate by 2024.
             I graduated from Sun Valley High School before going to college. After graduating from High School, I went to CPCC
             for a couple years then transfered to UNCC to finish my degree in Computer Science.
         </li>
         <li>Computer: I have recently gotten a dell inspiron 2-in-1 that has so far been good. It has a 17" screen.
              Before that, I had a microsoft computer of some sort. I don't know the name of it, it was just a cheap temporary one.
         </li>
         <li>Courses I'm taking right now and reason for each: 
         <ul>

         <li>English 2116: I was required to take it. So far its a little different from any other
             english course, yet at the same time its the same. I guess they expect better quality work on similar
             stuff from previous classes.
         </li>
         <li>ITSC3135: Required to take it and thought it would
         be interesting. So far it has been interesting and fairly easy to do. Just a lot of reading and work to keep up with.
         </li>
         </ul>
         </li>

             Funny Story:
         </li>
         <ul><!--needed to help align it up with everything else on screen-->
         <li>
            When I first got my two puppies, the second day of having them they were playing. While playing with each other
             they head butted each other by accident and all you could hear was a loud clunk. They did get back up though.
         </li>
         </ul>
         <li>Interesting fact:
         <ol>
         <li>I like to go catfishing with my dad.</li>
         <li>Biggest catfish we have caught was 75-80lbs(I wasn't there to catch or get it in the boat).</li>
         <li>I like to go to the beach a lot. Recently I haven't been able to get out on it.</li>
         <li>I have 3 dogs at home. One Boxer and two Mountain Feist.</li>
        </ol>
         </li>
         <li>
            I'd also like to share: I hope to be able to do web-design as a career.
         </li>
         </ol>

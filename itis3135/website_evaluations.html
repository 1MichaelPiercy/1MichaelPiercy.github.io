    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

  <h3><a href="http://www.greatdreams.com/" >Great Dreams</a></h3>
  <p class = "p">The website Great Dreams has been around for a while and has been horrendously updated since its founding.
      It seems to be focusing on end of the world type stuff and government takeover. It isn't to clear on that due to how much content it has and the lack of readability.
      Then most of the pictures on the website also seem to suggest that it does focus on the end of the world while some of the links suggest various other things.
      Overall, the website is just hard to understand. There is no uniformity to it nor any sub pages to go to that has everything seperate. 
      It is all just one big mess that makes it hard to figure out what the website is about. All I can say is that this website
      seems to be about the end of the world and government tyranny.
  </p>
  <ul class = "li">
  <li>
     Contrast: There's not much color variation when it comes to the background and the text. 
     That begins right after the pictures end and continue down the rest of the page. As you continue going down,
     there is no change in color to grab the user/readers attention.
  </li>
  <li>
   Repeated: The only thing that unifies this web-page is the back ground and foreground colors that are the same almost 2/3rd of the way down. 
   Then from there, the background colors change several different times as well.
   As a result, the web page doesn't run together smoothly at all nor does it read right.
  </li>
  <li>
      Allignment: Most of everything does seem to be ligned up right and doesn't seem to be in a different 
      table or box. Most of it is simply off center and thats it, the rest needs to be realigned or put into its own sub-page for the website.
      Then for the actual contents, nothing goes along with each other. It jumps from one to another at random. Nothing ends up corresponding with 
      what was abover or below it.

  </li>
  <li>
      Proximity: There is no spacing of anything on this website.
      Everything is cobbled together which makes it hard to read and navigate the website. The website also has 
      what seems like an infinite amount of links. Each link isn't even far enough away from the other 
      to keep from accidently clicking on the wrong link.
  </li>
  </ul>

        <h3><a href="https://studiobrave.com.au/work/" >Studio Brave</a></h3>
        <p class = "p">
            Studio Braves website is a well designed web-site meant to attract business. Everything seems to be layed out properly, 
            and all the space on the screen is used up to its potential to see that when you first get on the website. 
            It has a lot of animation and color to it. Infact, until you interact with the website they have a little animation set
            on an infinite loop playing. Showing the skill levels of their employees and what they can do for the customer.
        </p>
        
        <ul class = "li">
        <li>
            Contrast: For the most part, all the colors pop out and grab the user/readers attention.
            It doesn't really distract the user much up until it comes to the animation.
            The animations may end up distracting the user from finding what they need from the company. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Repition: They have everything grouped together in their respective parts of the website. The only
            thing that may cause confusion is some of the titling for the sub pages and what they are really for.
            They did keep all their work to one page without any of it overlapping. Although, they could try 
            and divide the work up in some sort of way to help tell the user what they are looking at.
        </li>
        <li>
            Alignment: This will be where the website seems to struggle the most. The picuters are alligned correctly, but they don't flow together.
            Theres to many pictures that don't connect in any sort of way. They all seem to be there just to show off what the company does. Everything else 
            on the website flows together. Its just on the work page where it doesn't.
        </li>
        <li>
            Proximity: Everything seems to be grouped in their respective areas on the website. The only part of the website that suffers
            is under the work title or the home page. It could be improved upon by somehow having one box down to the left or right of the other with subtitles.
            It would benefit them so much more if they did that and keep the reader from getting distracted.
        </li>

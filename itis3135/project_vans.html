        <h2>Client Info</h2>
        <p>Name: Andrew [Private]</p>
        <p>Business: Van Rentals</p>
        <p>Email: [private]</p>
        <p>Phone: [private]</p>
        

        <h2>Site Map</h2>
        <p >
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eggkm7eBAt4XMrXOh2kv9W78fHIeK6g5/view?usp=sharing">Click here for site map.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            On this website there will be a homepage. So far there has yet to be a name for the homepage of this website. There will be a menu at the top of the page 
            depicting names of each webpage and also acting as a link to each one. As of right now, the headers and footers will all look relatively the same and be consistently in the same spot.
            There won't be any difference aside for the header. We do plan to use jquery and javascript for interactivity. Those will be talked about down below for each webpage. We still need
            to figure out what webpages will involve jquery. The only definite one will be the payment for when you complete it. Then until I learn ajax, it will not be implemented, but from my understanding of it,
            it maybe beneficial on the vans webpage.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p >
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ffl0WZiV2mh_dV2GMQaK7tPkA137wUDb/view?usp=sharing">Click here for what default page</a>
        </p>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>The purpose of the application will be to rent a van. It will include multiple pages that can show off the vans, gather payment info, pickup location, etc. With each page helping to target different people. These people will
            mostly consist of moving of any sorts and DIYers or business owners, but
            mostly people that just need a van in general. It will also highlight other vans that they could use to achieve what they need.
        </p>
       <br>
       <h2>Homepage</h2>
        <p>For right now the homepage will serve as a hub. It will attract the attention of anyone in need of renting a van. The user will also be able to see a navigation menu 
            that will help them go from one part of the website to another. It will also have a form section allowing for the customer to sign up for a monthly email from the company for promotions.
            
            There does seem to be a plan to where you can also access other parts of the website through clicking the pictures and menu. No data will be collected aside 
            from getting data for location (this may change). We will not need to get data validation on this page at all.
        </p>

        <h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
        <p>
The main purpose of this page will be to collect data from the customer in the form of payments.
 This will be done through form elements. It will also allow them to schedule when to pick up the vehicle of their choosing and how long they want to keep it.
 There will be data validation to make sure its the right info and anything that needs to be filled out. It will not have any hyperlinks aside to 
 a webpage showing reviews for the company. The way the availability will be chosen will be through a drop down menu allowing them
 to select how long they need the van. Most likely showing it through days, weeks, and months. Once this is all done and submitted successfully, it will
 "delete" everything on the page and show the results.
        </p>

        <h2>Story of Van Rental</h2>
        <p>
            This page is solely meant to give the audience an idea of how the company was founded and what the goal of the founder is.
            It will not contain anything else aside from whats needed like pictures or collage of somesort. It is meant for anyone that maybe neaver heard nor seen the company around before.
            It will not collect any sort of data from the user. It may end up having interactive pictures in one way or another. It may also contain some sort of hyperlink to the vans portion of the page and a 
            google search of images showing vans.
        </p>
<h2>Vans</h2>
<p>
    This part of the website is specifically meant to show the vans to the customer. It will have pictures of the vans that the customer can select. There will be a hyperlink 
    at the bottom directing them to paymeant. It will also contain a description of the van such as what it will be best suited for, 
    items inside, engine size, etc. There is not much else planned other than links directing the customer to payment.
</p>
<h2>Store Locations</h2>
<p>
    A drop down menu with a picture of a map showing the locations of the stores will pop up. The customer can select where to pick up the van at by clicking on it through the drop
    down menu. Once this process is completed, a prompt will pop up in order to make sure the customer selected the right location they need to pick up the van at.
    The customer will not have to share any data about their location to achieve this. Text will also appear below the drop down menu saying what the customer picked.
    If they dicide to change locations, they can. The previous information will be erased and replaced.
</p>
<h2>Van Reviews</h2>
<p>
    Reviews of the company and its vans will be shown on this webpage. It will contain a table like format seperating each review with a button at the bottom
    to click on that allows more reviews to become available. Not sure if it will be drop down or go from page 1 to page 2 type deal yet. Only data that will be collected 
    is first name and general location of the customer. The date of which it was published will automatically show up. A user will be able to hover over 
    the review in order to enlarge it and get a better view of it.
</p>

<h2>Functionality of the Website</h2>
<p>We will have a somewhat basic calculator. What it will do is add up the total including the tax of the sale. We will also have a couple of areas for user input, like
    ordering the van, payment, replacement of images and text through the use of JavaScript. We will also use a special drop down menu that calls upon an array for the location while in use.></p>

         <ul>
         <li>Professional background: Currently I don't have a professional background in anything involving computers. All though I do work at a local chick-fil-a and obtained shift lead.</li>
         
         <li>
             Personal: I am 22 years old and have lived in Monroe, NC my whole life. I have 2 older siblings and I am the youngest of the three.
             Right now I am currently working at chick-fil-a and obtained shift lead there.
         </li>

         <li>Academic: Right now I am in my 4th year of college and plan to graduate by 2024.
             I did go to CPCC before going to UNCC.
         </li>
         <li>Computer: I have recently gotten a dell inspiron 2-in-1 that has so far been good. It has a 17" screen.
              Before that, I had a microsoft computer of some sort. I don't know the name of it, it was just a cheap temporary one.
         </li>
         <li>Courses I'm taking right now and reason for each: 
         <ul>

         <li>English 2116: I was required to take it.</li>
         <li>ITSC3135: Required to take it and thought it would
         be interesting. So far it has been interesting.
         </li>
         </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
             Funny Story:
         </li>
         <ul>
         <li>
            When I first got my two puppies, the second day of having them they were playing. While playing with each other
             they head butted each other by accident and all you could hear was a loud clunk. They did get back up though.
         </li>
         </ul>
         <li>Interesting fact:
         <ul>
         <li>I like to go catfishing with my dad.</li>
         <li>Biggest catfish we have caught was 75-80lbs.</li>
         </ul>
         </li>
         </ul>
